According to Kant, a noumenon is a thing as it is in itself, as distinct from a thing as it is knowable by the senses through phenomenal attributes.

Similarly, our concept of Noumenon represents the concep of the measurement whose values can be observed phenomonologically. The idea of white blood cell count is different from the actual measurement of white blood cells. There may be several ways to measure a biological concept which could be comparable longinatudially.

Simple Examples
---------------

* In January, WBC is observed by Quest. In June, WBC is observed by LabCorp for the same patient. Those two values can be compared to see whether WBC changed significantly for that patient, even though they were performed by different labs.
* In contrast, Free Testosterone from Quest should not be on the same chart as Total Testosterone. They both measure some aspect of testostonerone, but aren't comperable values.

Some Considerations
-------------------

* A noumenon is measured via an assay.
* Some assays may require conversion. [Body temperature](https://www.adctoday.com/learning-center/about-thermometers/how-take-temperature), for instance, may require adding or subtracting a few degrees to make values comperable. (We may also consider tracking margin of error in the future.)
* Two assays that measure the same noumenon should have similar reference ranges.

More Examples
-------------

* Magnesium in RBC is not the same as Magnesium in Serum.
* Bilirubin in Serum is not the same as Bilirubin in Urine.
* Calculated Free Testosterone and Free Testosterone are the same noumenon, though we are strongly considering annotating data to indicate whether values are calculated or measured.
* SBP at rest vs SBP after/during a consultation (even if just talking, which may increase blood pressure) would be different noumena.
