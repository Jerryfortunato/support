title: Cutometer Testing (Skin Elasticity)

**What does it measure?**

The elasticity of the skin.

**How does it measure it?**

The device uses gentle suction to the lift up the skin, then lets it fall and measures how quickly the skin recovers using a laser.

Procedure
---------

1. Open the Cutometer software. Make sure the green light on the front of the
device is illuminated. If not, there may be a problem with the port. See
“Troubleshooting Port Configuration” section XIV.
2. For a new patient go to Configuration → Personal Data → Persons.
a. Click on the plus sign (in the middle of the row of icons) and enter the
patient’s name (first then last).
b. Click on the ‘update’ icon (looks like a circular arrow) button.
c. The only required fields are first and last name. No need to enter
additional data in this window.
3. To select an existing patient go to Configuration → Personal Data → Overview.
a. Type the first letter of the patient’s last name in the first search box. DO
NOT type the patient’s entire name in the search box. This software will
not search using text.
b. Scroll down until you see the patient’s name (scroll using the right scroll
bar). Select the patient and click Exit.
4. The patient should be lying on the exam table. Ask the patient to put their palm up and relax their arm. Explain that it will not hurt, but they need to keep their arm still. Rest your right elbow on the exam table.
5. Click on the “Measurement” button on the top right side of the screen. The
probe charges.
6. While the probe charges, mark the appropriate spot (“landmark”) on the
patient’s arm with a pen:
a. Measure the distance (cm) from the crease of the wrist to the crease at
the elbow.
b. Mark a dot ¼ of this distance from the crease at the elbow.
i. An easy way to calculate 25% of the distance: divide the distance
in half, then divide in half again.
c. The probe should now be charged. Remove the cap from the probe.
Now it is ready to be positioned on the skin. After the probe charges, a
window appears with an ‘OK’ button. Do not click ‘OK’ until the probe is
placed on the skin.
d. For the first measurement, position the probe so that the opening is next
to the dot. Do not place the hole on top of the dot because the ink will
affect the measurement.
e. Avoid touching the skin where the probe is placed.

f. Make sure your elbow is supported and your forearm is resting on a firm
surface.
g. Take the probe and place it firmly and steadily perpendicular to the skin.
Do not apply too much pressure or too little.
h. If the patient has a hairy arm, try to find a spot that is less hairy alongside the dot you drew. If necessary, spread the hairs using two fingers and
gently place the probe in the middle against the bare skin.
i. If this step is difficult, separate the hairs and place one of the
“washer” stickers that came with the device over the skin while
holding the hairs back with two fingers. The washer will hold back
the hairs while you take the measurement.
i. Avoid the following artifacts: hairs, scars, pimples, freckles, tattoos,
rashes, etc.
7. Once the probe is placed on the skin, click ‘OK’ or press the space bar to begin measurement. Watch the screen as the curve is generated.
8. For the second measurement, place the probe above the original area measured,
as seen in the diagram below. Press the Space Bar twice.
9. For the third measurement, place the probe below the original area measured,
as seen in the diagram below. Press the Space Bar twice.
10. While the third curve is being measured, check to make sure that all three curves are consistent – it is preferable if the three curves are on top of one another. To confirm consistency of curves, focus on the tops (not the bottoms) of the first three curves. If one curve is more than one square (of the grid) apart from the adjacent curve, you have an outlier.
11. If you determine that you have an outlier, measure that curve again:
a. Click File > Close > Curve X (X being the curve you want to discard). Do
not save.
b. Reposition the probe and hit Measurement again to retake that curve.
12. When you have all three curves go to File-> Save->All curves

a. Make sure you are saving the data under the correct patient by checking
the patient name displayed.
b. Click Ok to save Curve 1, then repeat for Curves 2 and 3.
13. Print Results:
a. File → Print Results
b. Check to make sure there is data at the bottom of the report. If not, close
this window and save the curves again. (It’s OK if the bottom of the data
is cut off.)
c. Click the Printer icon to print.
d. NOTE: If you experience problems printing results in this way, try this
workaround:
i. Click Results > Results to EXCEL
ii. Print and then write the patient’s name on the report
14. IMPORTANT: Always close the software after use. Do NOT leave the software
open while not in use. This may cause cracks in the plastic housing that will
prevent the vacuum from developing pressure.
Notes:
- To open a previous report, go to File → Open → Curve 1 (takes a few seconds to
load). Search for the patient. Click on ‘Curve 1’ of desired report date. While
holding down the ‘Shift’ key, press the down arrow to select all the curves. Click
‘OK’ and curves will appear.
- If the patient’s arm seems to be oily or sweaty, wipe the area to be measured
with an alcohol swab, dry the area, then perform the measurement.
- If the there are two patients with the same last name, add a ‘1’ after the second
patient’s last name.
- If you enter two patients with the same last name, when you try to save the first
curve, another window appears. Click on the ‘Overview’ tab, then type the
patient’s last name one letter at a time (you have to click in the box where you
are typing after typing each letter or the software will not let you type). Once
you see both patients’ names displayed, click on the bottom arrow on the bar on
the right until the software selects the name you want (indicated by a black
arrow near the name on the left).
Calibration (video):
Check calibration every week (See Calibration video under Help at
physioagereporting.com):
1. Carefully clean the probe using the small interdental brush by rotating the brush
between two fingers in the aperture 3-4 times.

2. Click Measurement > Check Calibration. Follow the instructions on the screen
using the cap of the probe. There are two steps to calibration, A and B.
3. Compare the value on the screen to the value indicated on the side of the cap.
4. If calibration is still outside the acceptable range, clean and repeat two more
times, carefully following the instructions on the screen. If it’s still outside the
range:
a. Put one drop of the Isopropanol solution on the other interdental brush
and make sure that it is not dripping. Clean the probe and wait about 2
minutes to make sure that it is dry.
b. Then use the dry brush to clean once more, and repeat the calibration.
c. If it’s still outside the range, check it again in a few minutes. It may still
be wet.
d. If it’s still outside the range, send an email to Georg Khazaka at
GeKhazaka@courage-khazaka.de and copy support@physioage.com .
Include your practice name as well as the last six calibration test results
(three for A and three for B). Indicate the steps you’ve taken (dry
cleaning and wet cleaning) and ask for guidance. Georg may determine
that you will need to ship the probe to him in Germany for calibration.
(No calibration services are available in the US/Canada.)
5. If you can’t find the isopropanol solution or the interdental brushes, you can
purchase them at most pharmacies (rubbing alcohol (>20% concentration) and
interdental brushes.)

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Close the program and reopen it.
2. If that doesn’t work try rebooting the PC.
3. See Troubleshooting Port Configuration if the green light doesn’t illuminate.
