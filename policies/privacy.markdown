This Privacy Policy is part of, and incorporated into, the [Terms of Use](/tos).

Types of Information We Collect
===============================

We collect both Personal Information and Anonymous Information about our users.

Such information must be protected in accordance with the GDPR.

"Anonymous Information" is information that cannot be used to contact or identify you and is not linked to information that can be used to do so.  It includes passively collected information about your activities on the Services, such as usage data, to the extent that information is not linked to your Personal Information.

Authorized Users can access and browse certain portions of the Website and Services without disclosing Personal Information, although, like most website providers, we may passively collect certain information from your devices, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and browser information. Please note that you can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may not allow you full utilization of the Website and Service.

* Voluntarily Submitted Information. We collect information that you provide to us during your use of the Website and/or Services, such as:

We may correlate this information with other Personal Information we have about you. We may also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time you used the Website and Services and the information for which you searched and accessed. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your device while you are viewing a website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following web browser help directions.

  * We use third party services, such as Google Analytics, to track the volume, source and flow of visitors to our Website. We do this to better understand how you use the Website and Services, with a view to offering improvements for all Authorized Users, and to tailor our business activities accordingly.

You have the right to request:

* Access to the personal data we hold about you, free of charge in most cases.
* The correction of your personal data when incorrect, out of date or incomplete.
* The deletion of the data we hold about you, in specific circumstances. For example, when you withdraw consent, or object and we have no legitimate overriding interest, or once the purpose for which we hold the data has come to an end (e.g. the end of a warranty).
* A computer file in a common format (e.g. CSV or similar) containing the personal data that you have previously provided to us and the right to have your information transferred to another entity where this is technically possible.

%h2 Children
==============

This Website is not directed or intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit, collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Website is targeted to attract anyone under 13. We also do not send e-mail correspondence to anyone who advises that they are under the age of 13.  If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our systems and delete the Account.  If you are the parent or guardian of a child whom you believe has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at team@physioage.com so that we may delete and remove such information from our system.

%h2 Security and Data Retention
==============

We are very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ all reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, including 256-bit TLS encryption. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as it is consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. Although guaranteed security does not exist either on or off the Internet, we make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations.

We may need to transfer your Information to countries outside the European Economic Area, which comprises the EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein ("EEA"). Non-EEA countries that we may need to transfer your Information to include:

* USA, because our headquarters are based there.

Where we do transfer your Information to countries outside the EEA we will take reasonable steps in accordance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements.

%h2 Third Party Materials
==============

PhysioAge may provide links to other websites, or content and materials, that are owned and/or operated by third parties ("Third Party Materials").  PhysioAge does not investigate or monitor such Third-Party Materials, and therefore is not responsible or liable for the same.  Moreover, PhysioAge is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by third party websites, nor are we responsible for the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Website and Services; thus, when you use a link to go from our Website to a third-party website, this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. We encourage users to read and consider the privacy policies of these other websites before using them.

%h2 Changes to Our Privacy Policy
==============

We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless we advise you otherwise. However, we will not use your Personal Information in an adverse, materially different way from the uses described in this Privacy Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt out.  Your continued use of the Services after this Privacy Policy has been amended shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy, as amended. We encourage you to bookmark this webpage and review this Privacy Policy regularly.
